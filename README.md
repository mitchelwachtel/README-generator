### Description
This app is to be used to take the formatting out of creating a good README.md file. The user does not have to think about markdown formatting or what questions to answer, they simple answer the provided questions and this app does the hard work of creating the file.

---
### Installation
node.js, fs, and inquirer are needed in order to run this app. The user will need to install inquirer through the node package manager in the directory in which they are running this application.

---
### Usage
The application will run through a series of questions in your terminal. Answer them thoroughly in order for the README.md file to be completed fully. The README.md file will be created in the same directory in which the user is running this app. The file for the license logo is located in the assets folder within the app's directory, so if the user moves the README.md file, they need to be aware of this and relocate the .png file accordingly.
