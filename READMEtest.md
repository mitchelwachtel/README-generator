### Description
The biggest struggles in this project were finding the latitude and longitude for a city as it is searched. I had to research the openweather api documents, but I learned how to use the documentation for APIs through this struggle. Additionally, I had to figure out how to set up the elements and append them to the DOM. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to do this efficiently, even with a for loop to create the 5-day forcast.
